# 🛡️ PythonForDefensiveSecurityProjects

A collection of **lightweight, modular Python tools** designed for **defensive security workflows**.  
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work as a **fresher in cybersecurity**, showcasing my ability to design, develop, and document security-focused automation projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into separate branches, each focusing on a different aspect of defensive security.  

| Branch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ThreatIntel_TelegramBot** | (Briefly explain – e.g., Automates threat intelligence alerts via Telegram.) |
| **anti_analysis_and_evasion_detector** | (Briefly explain – e.g., Detects indicators of sandbox evasion or malware anti-analysis tricks.) |
| **python_network_traffic_analyzer** | (Briefly explain – e.g., Parses PCAPs to extract network flows and detect anomalies.) |
| **yara_directory_scanner** | (Briefly explain – e.g., Scans directories using YARA rules to find malicious files.) |

> 📝 **Note:** Each branch contains its own README with detailed setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples.
